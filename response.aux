The method from [13] does very well at short time scales due to its confidence, but we outperform all other methods at intermediate times. At long timescales the MHD to the trajectory of most algorithms converges. Our method increases positional uncertainty with time, and so [7] outperforms us because they know the end point and we do not, and [13] places too much significance on the positions of other pedestrians at large time scales.}}{2}}

Note that the initial dip in the performance of [7] is due to their confidence in their initial estimate. We sampled the S-LSTM model 100 times in order to give them the best chance in this analysis, but their confidence combined with the over-reliance on social forces at moderate-to-large lowered their performance.}}{2}}
